# Panini
Small code experiment w/ Panini projection

Panini projection has been around since around 2008
I only just learned about it recently (Feb 2026)
Both Unreal & Unity have official docs on using Panini projection

Reprojection interests me in general
Always wanted to render a 3D scene w/ a fisheye lens
Rectilinear, Equirectangular, Fisheye, Panini

Currently working on a SDL2 + OpenGL implementation
Planning to try a SDL3 + Vulkan implementation
